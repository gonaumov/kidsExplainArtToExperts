## Discussion

JJ's description about first picture was so non standart so 
really suprised me. Even Shana decided that this was something
non age-apropriate. Here I will try to describe The Birth of Venus 
by Sandro Botticelli. The picture displays a bay. Just near the 
shoreline is Venus - nude and only her hair is hidding some places
of her body. Venus is uprightiing in a mussel shell. From the right side
there is a woman which is dressed in old victorian fashion. The woman 
gives a cloack to Venus. From the left side there are angels who are 
flying dropping flowers on Venus.
